Values can be sorted by drag and drop.

**Selected by default:** When checked, this value will be selected when the form loads
**Value:** Similar to Field Name, this is the value saved with the submission and sent in notifications.
**Label:** (defaults to Value) Display a different label on the form.
_ex. For a long label, you might want to set the Value to something short and simple._

### Content

**Rows:** Set how tall you would like the text area to be. One row is equal to one line of text.
**Settings / Input Size:** Set a maximum length of characters allowed to be entered

### Select Field Options

Select fields are fields where the user can select one or more from a list of options (dropdown, radio group, checkbox group, listbox). Select field options also have options and actions. After the options are created and saved (ID will have a value), you can edit the option to set these configurations. Options can be hidden by default, and have available the same actions provided on fields.

## Field Actions

Field actions provide the ability to make the form more dynamic. These will be used to show or hide fields, based on conditions you create. Build conditions by selecting various fields and setting the requirements that must be met for the action to take place. For example, you may want the State dropdown to only show when the Country selected is United States. The State field would be set to Hide By Default. An action would created for the State field to show the field when the value of Country is &quot;United States&quot;. Hiding the field first and only showing when United States is selected will be easier that selecting all countries you don&#39;t want it to show for, but its possible to configure that was as well.

When all conditions of an action are met, it is triggered. More than one action can be triggered, even when conditions are different, as long as they&#39;re met.

## Action Conditions

Select one or more fields to monitor. Based on the field type, you can choose to trigger the action when the user selects or enters any value, does not select or has not entered any value, or only when specific values are selected. When a multi-option field is being monitored, you&#39;ll be provided with the list of all options to choose which specific options might trigger the action.

### Change Field Display

Make the current field displayed or hidden. If the Hide By Default box is checked, this action will show the field. If unchecked, this action will hide the field.

### Change Selection Display

Only available on select field options. Will show or hide the option based on the Hide By Default setting.

### Adjust Charge Amount (Only available on payment fields)

Set a positive or negative amount the charge should be adjusted, when conditions are met.

## Form Actions

Form actions are triggered when the form is loaded or the user submits the form. There are no conditions to monitor, its a simple action that will be triggered on every occurrence.

Currently, form actions are only be triggered when the form is successfully submitted.
